# DocMan

DocMan hopes to be the most comprehensive piece of software to manage all of your documentation. You can schedule your documentation for review between stakeholders, the original authors, contributors, relevant tech leads, etc... Categorize, analyze, version repositories, and basically everything you would need to keep your documentation well organized, maintained, analyzed, and backed up.

## Feature Upgrades

A list of features I plan on implementing into the application.

1. File Uploads
   1. The ability to upload documentation in many formats, including:
      1. Word
      2. PDF
      3. TXT
      4. MD
      5. XLS
      6. RTF
2. User system, authentication and security
   1. Some sort of authentication system
      1. Should I build a custom solution or use a 3rd party?
      2. Possible 3rd party solutions:
         1. OAuth
   2. Email notifications
      1. User can chose to be notified on certain things. Some things are mandatory based on their association with the documentation.
   3. User profiles
      1. Users can add information about themselves that will be available to other users of the system and they can customize the UI in a limited fashion.
   4. Restrict rate-limiting per IP/User
   5. Inactivity timeout
3. Scheduling
   1. Authors, contributors, and stake-holders can be scheduled to review documentation.
   2. Can set review deadlines
   3. If review determines updates are needed, can assign to authors and contributors.
